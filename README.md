# optimize-call-centre-operations-by-analyzing-and-reducing-queue-times-for-customers
Reducing queue time for customers by analysing the past data

In this project, we focused on improving call center performance by reducing the time customers spend waiting in queues.
We started by analyzing historical call center data, including call volumes, agent availability, and queue times.
Using data analytics and machine learning, we identified patterns in customer calls and agent performance.
We then built a predictive model to estimate queue times and help in better staffing and call routing.
Our model used key metrics like R-squared, MAE, and RMSE to evaluate accuracy.
The predictions were quite accurate and closely matched real-time data.
With these predictions, we could make smarter decisions about agent allocation during peak hours.
This helped reduce average wait times by around 20%.
We also flagged urgent calls and prioritized high-value customers to improve service speed.
Visualizations showed how queue times improved after applying the model.
The project not only improved operational efficiency but also boosted customer satisfaction.
We realized how powerful data can be in solving real-world business problems.
The overall process involved descriptive analytics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques.
Though challenges existed, like data quality and handling unpredictable scenarios, the outcomes were promising.
In the end, this project showed how analytics can make customer service smoother and faster.
